A Python module for configuring, running, analyzing, and visualizing results 
based on metrics calculated from language model scores.

## Features
- **Configuration**: Easily set up with `config.py`.
- **Tensor Initialization**: Prepare evaluation tensors for storing scores using `tensors.py`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Run language model forward passes and collect scores in `eval.py`.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze and compute correlations based on scores with `corr.py`.
- **Visualization**: Generate graphs and insights based on calculated metrics with`display.py`.
